Buliding of sonnet.library and associated programs requires the following tools:

- vasm (current source as of 2015-03-03 or newer).
- vlink (current source as of 2015-03-03 or newer).
- GNU Make.
- AmigaOS 3.9 NDK - currently this requires some manual fixing, as not all 
  includes are present with the distribution, see issue #6 on GitHub. 
- WarpOS 5.1 include files (WarpUP_V51Upd.lha on AmiNet). 

Building is supported on both AmigaOS and UNIX-likes, just export HOST variable
when running make, i.e.:

$ make HOST=unix

Path to NDK includes should be provided, on AmigaOS with incluide_i: assign, on
UNIX-like OSes with INCLUDE_I environment variable. For example:

$ INCLUDE_I=/opt/amiga-cross/NDK_3.9/Include/include_i/
$ export INCLUDE_I

Obviously, when building on UNIX, WarpOS includes must also be installed below
$INCLUDE_I path.
