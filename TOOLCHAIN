Buliding of sonnet.library and associated programs requires a specially 
prepared development environment.

# Prerequisites

* vasm - current source as of 2015-03-03 or newer.
* vlink - current source as of 2015-03-03 or newer.
* GNU Make - any fairly new version will suffice.
* AmigaOS 3.9 NDK - currently this requires some manual fixing, issue #6 on
  GitHub and below for further instructions. 
* WarpOS 5.1 include files (WarpUP_V51Upd.lha on AmiNet). 
* patch - if you want to automatically fix the NDK, available on AmiNet.

# Fixing the NDK

Apply the following patch to the AmigaOS 3.9 NDK:
http://sonnet.uguu.waw.pl/patch-ndk-1.diff

# Building

Building is supported on both AmigaOS and UNIX-likes, just export HOST variable
when running make, i.e.:

$ make HOST=unix

Path to NDK includes should be provided, on AmigaOS with incluide_i: assign, on
UNIX-like OSes with INCLUDE_I environment variable. For example:

$ INCLUDE_I=/opt/amiga-cross/NDK_3.9/Include/include_i/
$ export INCLUDE_I

Obviously, when building on UNIX, WarpOS includes must also be installed below
$INCLUDE_I path.
