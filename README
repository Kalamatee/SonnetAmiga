SonnetAmiga
===========

This project is an attempt at reimplementation of WarpOS for Sonnet Crescendo
7200 PCI cards.

The main part of the project is sonnet.library, which aims at API and ABI
compatibility with WarpOS powerpc.library.

This project is in very early stage of development. Don't expect it to do
anything useful (yet).

# Hardware

The only supported PCI bridge is ELBOX Mediator 4000 Mk-II. It is necessary 
to have graphics card installed and currently the only supported card is 3Dfx 
Voodoo 3.

# Building

See TOOLCHAIN file for building instructions.

# Bugs

We're using GitHub Issues for bug tracking:
https://github.com/Sakura-IT/SonnetAmiga/issues

If you find any new bugs, please report them.

# Disclaimers

We, the developers, are officially stating that all code interacting with 
Mediator boards was developed without access to the official Mediator SDK.
This project is not endorsed by ELBOX in any way.
