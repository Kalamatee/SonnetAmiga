SonnetAmiga
===========

This project is an attempt at reimplementation of WarpOS for Sonnet Crescendo
7200 PCI cards.

The main part of the project is sonnet.library, which aims at API and ABI
compatibility with WarpOS powerpc.library.

This project is in very early stage of development. Don't expect it to do
anything useful (yet).
