SonnetAmiga

This project is an attempt at reimplementation of WarpOS for Sonnet Crescendo
7200 PCI cards.

The main part of the project is sonnet.library, which aims at API and ABI
compatibility with WarpOS powerpc.library.

The only supported PCI bridge is Elbox Mediator 4000 Mk-II. It is necessary 
to have graphics card installed and currently the only supported card is 3Dfx 
Voodoo 3.

This project is in very early stage of development. Don't expect it to do
anything useful (yet).

See TOOLCHAIN file for building instructions.
