The TO-DO list (28MAY15):

PPC -> 68K Communication	90%	PutXMsg/WaitForPPC need rewrite
68K -> PPC Communication	90%	PutXMsgPPC/WaitFor68K need rewrite
Scheduler			50%	Multitasking is implemented and working in a simple preemptive round-robin system
MMU Table Setup			00%	Needs to be rewritten to tables so WarpOS can use the BATs
PPC -> PPC Communication	25%	The likes of PutMsgPPC etc. still needs to be written
Library Functionality		75%	25% of the functions not working or not implemented. Mostly internal Msg, task and debug related
Cache Coherency			80%	No coherency after data loaded by 68K (loadseg(), read()). L2 Cache is the culprit
WarpOS Compatibility		25%	Simple programs work after patching. Patching will be mandetory or recompilation.
AmigaOS Patcher			00%	To catch certain output of functions through Run68K() and copy them to sonnet space.
Hardware emulator		00%	To catch calls from PPC to hardware and redirect to 68K through Run68KLowLevel()
